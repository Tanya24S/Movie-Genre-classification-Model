# Movie-Genre-classification-Model

Task Objectives:

■ The objective is to develop a model that classifies movies into genres.

■ Requires working with text-based movie plot descriptions, which need to be processed into a format suitable for machine learning models.

■ Involves applying appropriate techniques to convert raw text into numerical vectors.

■ Various classifiers should be explored to determine the best fit for classification.

■ Expected Outcome: A well-trained model capable of accurately classifying movies into genres based on textual descriptions, along with insights into feature importance and misclassifications.
